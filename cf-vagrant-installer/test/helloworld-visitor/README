Tuscany - Getting Started - Helloworld JSONRPC Sample
-----------------------------------------------------

This sample extends the helloworld sample to make the helloworld service available as a JSON-RPC endpoint.
JSON-RPC is a protocol for doing remote procedure calls encoded in JSON.

The changes to the helloworld sample are:
- update the pom.xml with the additional dependencies
- update the composite to use the JSON-RPC binding 

As with all the getting-started samples you can run this sample with:

   mvn tuscany:run 

Then at a web browser enter the following URL:
(JSON-RPC aruguments are base64 encoded, so in this URL "WyJXb3JsZCJd" unecoded is "["World"]")

   http://localhost:8080/HelloworldComponent/Helloworld?method=sayHello&params=WyJXb3JsZCJd&id=1

which should return a page saying:

   {"id":1,"result":"Hello World"}
